# Basic Example

This example shows the basic usage of the library with the following scenarios:

- Sign in
- Sign out
- Loading the user on the server side and adding it as part of SSR (`/pages/profile.js`)
- Loading the user on the client side and using fast/cached SSR pages (`/pages/index.js`)
- API Routes which can load the current user (`/pages/api/me.js`)
- Using hooks to make the user available throughout the application (`/lib//user.js`)
